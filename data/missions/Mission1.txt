Welcome to Chicky Graphs. Here at Tardigradus Farm, many eggs have just hatched. Mike the farmer needs some help to watch the newborn chicks. Let's discover the farmâ€™s life, and watch the chicks grow together.
***
To do so, we will learn together the theory of graphs. You will need to create chicks and to link them together.
***
To create a chick, you just have to do a left click. To move it, you need to keep the left click. Try it!
***
To delete a chick, just do a right click.
***
If you keep the right click between two chicks, it will create a link between them.
***
You can delete a link by keeping the left click and passing throught it.
***
Other commands on a chick: i (infect), c (contamination), n (change style)
***
Perfect! You are ready!
