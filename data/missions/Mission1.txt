Welcome to Chicky Graphs. Here at Tardigradus Farm, many eggs have just hatched. Mike the farmer needs some help to watch the newborn chicks. Come and discover the farmâ€™s life, and watch the chicks grow together.
***
To do so, we will learn together the theory of graph. You will need to create chicks and to link them together.
***
To create a chick, you just have to do a left click. To move it, you need to keep the left click. Try it!
***
To delete a chick, just do a right click. Try it!
***
If you keep the right click between two chicks, it will create a link between them. Try it!
***
Perfect! You are ready!
