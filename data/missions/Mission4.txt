The idea is using the matrice which which is a 2D array corresponding to number poussin^2.
If there is an edge between two poussins, there is a T for true inside the matrice at the corresponding place. In that way, connect poussins to each other using it."

The problem is that it uses many space and you will have some difficulties to delete a node ( chick) if you want to delete it from the matrix."
