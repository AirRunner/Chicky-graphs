text1 = "Try to implement it using an Adjacency Matrix.
The idea is using the matrice which which is a 2D array corresponding to number poussin^2.
If there is an edge between two poussins, there is a T for true inside the matrice at the corresponding place. In that way, connect poussins to each other using it."

text2 = "So here using a boolean matrix to express the graph: an adjacency matrix, you have create a graph.
The problem is that it uses many space and you will have some difficulties to delete a node ( chick) if you want to delete it from the matrix."
